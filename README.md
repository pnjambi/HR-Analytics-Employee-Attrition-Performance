**I used a dataset from Kaggle to explore factors that lead to employee attrition.**

The aim of visualizing the data was to; 
* Identify departments with higher attrition rates to help address any underlying issues
* To analyze the distribution of employees across various age-groups
* To measure employee satisfaction levels
* Help HR department to understand the attrition patterns based on gender to help identify gender disparities and implement targeted attrition strategies. 
* Analyze attrition based on education fields
